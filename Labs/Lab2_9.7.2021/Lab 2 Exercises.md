1. You have been tasked with creating a time converter program. This program will require you to first ask the users for a time in seconds (e.g 2500 seconds) using the prompt “Please enter a number of seconds:” Once the program receive the input, the program will then calculate the number of hours based on the input number. In addition, the program will also figure out the remainder of minutes and seconds that are left within the initially identified time after the time has been converted into hours (e.g if the time given was 7265 seconds, then the remainder after the conversion will be one minute and 5 seconds). After the conversion been completed, your program will print out the results using the following sentences:  
	a) Here is the time in Hours, Minutes, and Seconds  
	b) Hours:  
	c) Minutes:  
	d) Seconds:  

2. You have been tasked with creating a program that asks the user for the original price of a given item X, Considering it is the test drive phase of the program, the store is offering a 15% discount for all customers who came to the store to purchase item X. Your program will calculate the cost of the item X after the discount, the sales tax associated with the transaction (5.6%) and the final cost of the transaction. The sample output should include the price of item after discount has been applied, the total amount of tax that was due, and the total cost of the transaction. Remember, each of those prices that are being displayed must follow a lead in sentence indicating which number is what:  
	a) The price of item X after discount is:  
	b) The sales tax associated with the transaction is:  
	c) The total cost of the transaction is:  

3. You have been instructed to create a program that calculate the monthly payment that is due for the user. The program will first ask the user to enter the annual expenses that are responsible for, then the program will calculate the monthly cost, the quarterly cost and the bi-annual cost in which the user must pay and display it on terminal.  

4. You have been instructed to create a program that transforms a floating-point value into a currency using the format function within a print statement. Your program will first ask the user for a value, and then display the value that was inputted by the user as a currency with 2 decimal points.  

5. Similar to question 4, but try to follow the same pattern and create a program have the user enter a integer value instead of a float value that gets displayed as a currency.
