1. You are responsible of creating a loan qualification robot that determines the eligibility of loan applicants based on two criteria: their annual salary and how many years they have been employed. Your program should ask the user how much money they make annually in USD and how many years they have been working. The program will then take their input and evaluate that against the pre-existing criteria where minimum salary needed is 45000 and that the minimum employment duration must be great than 3 years. If they satisfy the salary requirement, then your program should print “Congratulations, you have satisfied the minimum wage requirement”, after verifying the salary, the program should verify the duration of their employment, if it meets this requirement as well, then the program will say “Congratulations, you qualify for the loan”. If the applicant does not meet the salary requirement then your program should print “We are sorry, but at this time we are not able to approve your loan application as the required salary is X”, if the applicant does not meet the employment duration then the program should say, “we are sorry, but you must have been working for at least X years before we can approve your loan”.


2. You are responsible to program a test average calculator. Your program will ask the user to enter three different test grades. The program will then calculate the average of the score and display the result using the string “The average score of your tests is: X”, in addition to this statement, the program should also very to see if the calculated average score meets the exceptional criteria of 95 points. If it surpasses the 95 point bar then your program should also print the statement “Congratulation on scoring high marks on your exam, welcome to the honors roll”

3. You are working on creating an auto grader robot, the robot uses the following grading standards:

    A+ = 95+, between 95 and 90 = A

    B+ = 87+ between 86 and 83 = B between 80 and 82 is B-

    C+ = 75+ and between 70 to 75 is C

    D+ = 68+ and between 61 and 68 = D

    F = anything below 61.

Your program must ask the user to input a test grade and your program will then display the corresponding letter grade in which the user should receive using the following string format “Hello, your letter grade in correspondence with your score is: X” In addition, you must ensure that the user cannot enter a score that is less than 0 or greater than 100. If they do, you must display the statement “The score you input is invalid, program will now Exit please try again later.”
